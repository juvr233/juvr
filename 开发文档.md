I. Overall Architecture Design
* Layered Architecture:
    * Presentation Layer (Frontend): Responsible for user interaction and data display. Employs a responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.
    * Application Layer (Backend): Handles user requests, orchestrates business logic, calls AI services, generates product recommendations, and manages caching strategies.
    * Domain Layer: Contains core numerology algorithms and AI inference logic.
    * Data Layer: Responsible for data persistence, including user information, test results, and product information.
    * Infrastructure Layer: Includes caching, message queues, logging services, and authentication.
* Technology Stack:
    * Frontend: React (or other modern frontend frameworks like Vue.js, Angular), TypeScript
    * Backend: Python (Django/Flask), Node.js (Express)
    * Database: PostgreSQL (or other relational databases like MySQL)
    * Cache: Redis, Memcached
    * AI Services: Consider using cloud platform AI services (e.g., Azure Cognitive Services, AWS AI Services, Google Cloud AI Platform) or building a self-hosted AI model service.
    * Message Queue: RabbitMQ, Kafka (for asynchronous task processing, such as AI model training and updating)
    * Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token), OAuth 2.0
    * Mobile App: React Native, Flutter (cross-platform solutions)
* High Availability Architecture Design:
    * Load Balancing: Nginx (or HAProxy) distributes traffic to multiple backend servers.
    * Multi-Instance Deployment: Deploy multiple instances of backend services to ensure that a single point of failure does not affect the overall service.
    * Database Master-Slave Replication: Ensures data security and read performance; the master database handles write operations, and the slave database handles read operations.
    * Automatic Failover: The monitoring system detects service status in real-time and automatically switches traffic to healthy instances.
    * Service Degradation: When dependent services are unavailable, provide alternative solutions or friendly prompts to avoid cascading failures.

    * Perform performance testing to ensure stable system operation.
* Operations and Maintenance Phase:
    * Monitor the system status and handle faults in a timely manner.
    * Conduct regular security audits and performance optimization.
IV. Quality Assurance Measures
* Code Specifications:
    * Unified coding style, use unified code specifications (such as PEP 8 for Python).
    * Write clear comments to improve code readability.
* Unit Testing:
    * Write unit tests to cover core business logic.
    * Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).
* Code Review:
    * Conduct code reviews to check code quality and potential problems.

    * Use tools such as JMeter and LoadRunner for performance testing.
    * Simulate high concurrency scenarios to evaluate system performance.
* Security Testing:
    * Conduct security vulnerability scans and fix security vulnerabilities.
    * Prevent security issues such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
V. Multi-Platform Adaptation Strategy

    * Adopt a responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.
    * Use CSS frameworks (such as Bootstrap, Materialize) to simplify development.
* Mobile App:
    * Use cross-platform frameworks such as React Native or Flutter for one-time development and multi-platform operation.
    * Optimize for different platforms to improve the user experience.
    * Use native modules to call device-specific functions.
VI. AI Model Optimization Strategies
* Data Augmentation:
    * Data augmentation is a key technique to improve the performance of AI models, especially when the amount of data is limited. By performing various transformations on existing data, the diversity of data can be artificially increased, thereby improving the generalization ability of the model. For example, for image data, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color adjustment can be performed; for text data, synonym replacement, random insertion, deletion, and exchange can be performed.
* Ensemble Learning:
    * Ensemble learning is a method to improve prediction performance by combining multiple models. Common ensemble learning methods include Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Bagging trains multiple models by sampling the original data set with replacement, and then averages or votes on their prediction results. Boosting iteratively trains the model, paying more attention to the samples that the previous model made mistakes on, and finally combines all the models into a strong learner. Stacking trains a meta-model to learn how to best combine the prediction results of other models.
* Continuous Learning and Fine-tuning
    * The performance of AI models is not constant. Over time and with the emergence of new data, the performance of the model may decline. In order to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the model, it is necessary to update and fine-tune the model regularly. Continuous learning is a method that allows the model to continuously learn new knowledge and adapt to new environments. Fine-tuning refers to retraining a pre-trained model with a small amount of data from a specific field, so that the model can better adapt to a specific task.
VII. Risk Management
* Technical Risks:
    * Low accuracy of AI models: Models need to be continuously optimized and human intervention is required.
    * System Performance Bottleneck: Performance testing and optimization are required.
    * Security Vulnerabilities: Security audits are needed to fix vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
* Project Management Risks:
    * Frequent requirement changes: Need to strictly control requirement changes and assess the impact.
    * Schedule Delays: Need to rationally arrange development plans and conduct risk assessments.
* Market Risks:
    * Intense competition: Need to continuously innovate and improve the user experience.
    * User mistrust: Need to ensure the consistency of test results and provide high-quality services.
