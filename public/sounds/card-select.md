# Card Selection Sound

Place a card selection sound file here named "card-select.mp3".

This sound will be played when a user selects a tarot card during reading.

Recommendation:
- A soft click or tap sound (0.1-0.3 seconds in duration)
- Low volume level (should be subtle)
- Clear but not distracting

Note: If this file is missing, the application will attempt to play the sound but will silently fail without affecting the user experience.
