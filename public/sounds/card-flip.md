# Card Flip Sound

Place a card flipping sound file here named "card-flip.mp3".

This sound will be played when tarot cards are revealed/flipped during reading.

Recommendation:
- A soft swoosh or paper flipping sound (0.5-1.5 seconds in duration)
- Medium-low volume level (should be noticeable but not jarring)
- Natural sound that fits the mystical theme

Note: If this file is missing, the application will attempt to play the sound but will silently fail without affecting the user experience.
